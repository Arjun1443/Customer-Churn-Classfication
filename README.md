# Customer-Churn-Classfication
Customer Churn Prediction This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops using a company's product or service. The goal is to build a model that can identify potential churners based on historical data and customer behavior.

🔍 Project Overview
The objective is to develop a predictive model that classifies customers into churn or non-churn categories based on various attributes such as usage patterns, subscription details, and customer interactions.

📊 Models Used
Three machine learning models were implemented and compared:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest

📌 Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.
Encoded categorical variables.
Normalized numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed factors contributing to customer churn.
Visualized churn rates across different customer segments.
Model Training & Evaluation:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Applied hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

📈 Results
Logistic Regression: Provided baseline interpretability but limited predictive power.
Decision Tree: Captured patterns well but prone to overfitting.
Random Forest: Delivered the best performance with improved generalization.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
